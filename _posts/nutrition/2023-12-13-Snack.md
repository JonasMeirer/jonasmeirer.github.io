I like to go to bed without feeling full from a heavy evening meal, so I try to eat most of my calories before lunch break ends. Adding this snack adds the extra calories I need and is super tasty. I eat it some time between lunch and dinner, usually at ~3pm.

## Still hungry? 

On top, if I know that I won't get much protein for dinner, I'll have a [protein shake](/hidden_posts/food/2023-12-13-Shake.html).

Full credit goes to Bryan Johnson for making his routine and meals publicly available. He's spending a ton of time and money optimising his life, and having his insights freely available is extremely valuable. It served me as a basis for many things I incorporated into my life. In this case, the basic ingredients come from him, but I adapted it to better fit my vitamin and mineral requirements.
