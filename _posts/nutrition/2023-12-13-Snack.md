I like to go to bed without feeling full from a heavy evening meal, so I try to eat most of my calories before lunch break ends. Adding this snack adds the extra calories I need and is super tasty. I eat it some time between lunch and dinner, usually at ~3pm.

On top, if I know that I won't get much protein for dinner, I'll have a [protein shake](/hidden_posts/food/2023-12-13-Shake.html).
