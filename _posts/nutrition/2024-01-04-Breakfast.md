6am. Alarm rings. Ready to start the day. For me the morning hours are the time of the day to get stuff done. So naturally I don't want to spend much time thinking about food or preparing it. 

The solution? 

## Intermittent fasting

I've discovered intermittent fasting a few years ago, and for me it's been one of the most impactful lifestyle changes in terms of how I subjectively feel. Among the most important changes is an increased mental clarity in the morning, making me a lot more productive. It shifts focus away from food and frees up time spent eating breakfast. 

More to come on the science of it!
