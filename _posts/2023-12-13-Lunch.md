# Veggies, Lentils, etc.

## Goal
- Easy to pre-cook
- Nutrient rich
- Avoids after-meal crash
- Tasty

I usually bring my food to work and don't want to spend evening pre-cooking, or thinking too much about what I'll have the next day. I generally want a meal that fuel me, doesn't make we want to sleep right after and tastes great.
