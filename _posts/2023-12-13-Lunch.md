Lunch is the time for fueling the body with everything it needs. Ideally I've been super productive in the morning, so now is the time to refill the energy storage and rest. 

I love to take a two hour lunch break in which I can detach from work. Helps me with creativity, energy and happiness in general, since I can spend the time with friends, reading or simply enjoying my food.


# Veggies, Lentils, etc.

## Goal
- Easy to batch-cook -- *I bring food to work, so I want to easily prepare it*
- Nutrient rich
- Avoids after-meal crash -- *productivity should continue after lunch, not end there*
- Tasty
