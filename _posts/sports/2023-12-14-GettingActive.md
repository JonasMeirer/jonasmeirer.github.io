You're not convinced? Let's get into why you should be moving a lot.

Let's start with a section from a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4663/7/5/127" target="_blank">paper</a> I like:

*"Human biology requires a certain amount of physical activity to maintain good health and wellbeing. [...] People living today have, more or less, the same requirements for physical activity as 40,000 years ago. For an average man with a body weight of 70 kg, this corresponds to about 19 km daily walking in addition to everyday physical activity."*

Seems like we've gotten a bit lazy. But is that really so bad?

*"For most people, daily physical activity decreases, while planned, conscious exercise and training increases. Unfortunately, average daily energy intake is increasing more than daily energy output, creating an energy surplus. This is one reason for the increasing number of overweight people, and a strong contributor to many health problems."*

Ups, seems like we should be moving more... but what if I like a big round belly?

*"Not reaching recommended level of physical activity, combined with increased energy intake, impairs both physical and mental capabilities and increases the risk of disease."*

Well okaay, it seems like sports are beneficial. But let's also look at some data about *just how* good physical activity is for you.

Getting motivated? Let's also look at all cause mortality.

This one is a bit more tricky to understand. It shows the relation between changes in physical fitness and changes in mortality over time. In the study, participants were evaluated at baseline (PF1) and again 13 years later (PF2).  Participants were grouped according to fitness quartiles (Q1 = least fit, Q4 = most fit) for the baseline evaluation and to quartiles for change in fitness from baseline to 13-year follow-up (Q1 PF2/PF1 = least change, Q4 PF2/PF1 = most change).

Long story short, there's two things that help you not to die early. One is being fit, the other is getting more fit. 

Plus, exercising just feels amazing once you get into the habit. I wouldn't want to miss it in my life.

For everyone looking for some inspiration what you can do, here's some of what I enjoy.
