Physical activity is one of the most powerful things you can do for health and happiness. I simply counln't be without, and turns out that's pretty much encoded in our genes. We need movement, elevated heart rate, sweating, exhaustion, etc. to biologically function. There are so many good things about it - and I'll probably write more about it in the future - but for now, let's focus on the basics. *Getting active!*

Let's start with a section from a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4663/7/5/127" target="_blank">paper</a> I like:

*"Human biology requires a certain amount of physical activity to maintain good health and wellbeing. [...] People living today have, more or less, the same requirements for physical activity as 40,000 years ago. For an average man with a body weight of 70 kg, this corresponds to about 19 km daily walking in addition to everyday physical activity."*

Seems like we've gotten a bit lazy in our society. But is that really so bad?

*"For most people, daily physical activity decreases, while planned, conscious exercise and training increases. Unfortunately, average daily energy intake is increasing more than daily energy output, creating an energy surplus. This is one reason for the increasing number of overweight people, and a strong contributor to many health problems."*

Whoops, seems like we should be moving more...

*"Not reaching recommended level of physical activity, combined with increased energy intake, impairs both physical and mental capabilities and increases the risk of disease."*

Well okaay, it seems like sports are beneficial. But let's also look at some data about *just how* good physical activity is for you.

Think of MET here as the maximal intensity of a workout you can do. 

*One MET is defined as the energy expended in sitting quietly. 2 METs will correspond to an activity that is twice the resting metabolic rate. Activities of 2 to 4 METs (light walking, doing household chores, etc.) are considered light, whereas for example running can yield 10 or more METs. As an example, a patient with a peak capacity of seven METs cannot engage in skipping (8â€“10 METs). So it's in a way reflecting your fitness level.*

Judging from the graphic, it seems pretty worth it to be fit. And the good news is:

*"Poor physical fitness is a modifiable risk factor, and improvements in fitness over time have been demonstrated to improve health prognoses."*

One more concrete example:

*"Physically inactive middle-aged women (engaging in less than 1 hour of exercise per week) experienced a 52% increase in all-cause mortality, a doubling of cardiovascular-related mortality and a 29% increase in cancer-related mortality compared with physically active women."*

Getting motivated? Let's also look at all cause mortality, also in relation to what happens if you're not fit right now, but want to get there.

This one is a bit more tricky to understand. It shows the relation between changes in physical fitness and changes in mortality over time. In the study, participants were evaluated at baseline (PF1) and again 13 years later (PF2).  Participants were grouped according to fitness quartiles (Q1 = least fit, Q4 = most fit) for the baseline evaluation and to quartiles for change in fitness from baseline to 13-year follow-up (Q1 PF2/PF1 = least change, Q4 PF2/PF1 = most change).

Long story short, there's two things that help you to not die early. One is being fit, the other is getting more fit. 

Plus, exercising just feels amazing once you get into the habit. I wouldn't want to miss out on it.

For everyone looking for some inspiration what you can do, here's some of what I enjoy.
