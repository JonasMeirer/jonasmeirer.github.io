# Morning shake

## Goal
- Fast 
- High protein (it's hard to get enough)
- Low carb (to not get hungry again soon after)

I usually don't want to spend much time thinking about food in the morning. The easiest for me is to just have a protein shake (+ some extra ingredients) which easily powers me through the morning. 

## Recipe

### Prerequisites

- Protein powder mix (I pre-mix in the ratio of 3 cups of pea protien, 2 cups of rice protein and 1 cup of hemp protein)

### Ingredients

- 50g of protein powder
- 1 Tbsp of Chlorella powder
- 1 Tbsp of organic cocoa powder (as natural as possible)
- 1 tsp of organic ceylon cinnamon 
- 2g of Creatine

### How-to

Mix with water, done.
