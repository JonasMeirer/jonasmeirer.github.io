6am. Alarm rings. Ready to start the day. For me the morning hours are the time of the day to get stuff done. So naturally I don't want to spend much time thinking about food or preparing it.


The easiest for me is to just have a protein shake (+ some extra ingredients) which easily powers me through until lunch.

- Fast -- *can be prepared the evening before*
- High protein -- *it's hard for me to get enough*
