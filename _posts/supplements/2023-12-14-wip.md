This is not an easy one. My attitude towards supplements has fluctuated from super amazing to super annoying, and there are several reasons for that. To begin with, I don't like that there's a massive industry behind it that uses all sorts of tricks to get people to spend a lot of money for things they probably don't need. More importantly, it might even give people the feeling of "doing a lot for their health", when they are really just eating a lot of supplments but neglecting sports, nutrition and sleep. Which leads me to another really important point: the effect of supplements for the general population is usually very small compared to what you can achieve with an active lifestyle (including the right amount of sports), good nutrition and a good night of sleep. So before you get all excited about supplements, please focus first on the other lifestyle adaptations. 

That being said, there are very good reasons for taking supplements. And I will try to give you a very pragmatic way of looking at it. I try to think about it in three steps:

1. Covering basic vitamin and mineral needs
2. Identifying areas of interest which can be targeted with specific supplements
3. Evaluating the effects of the supplement in a scientific way 

Let's break it down. 

## Step 1
I first want to get a feeling for my basic requirements, and the degree to which my nutrition covers this need. In order to judge this, I wrote some scripts to pull nutritional values of the foods that I describe in the nutrition section of this website. I then aggregrated all the nutrients, and compared them to my daily requirements. Here's the result: [Table of vitamins and minerals](/hidden_posts/food/2024-01-04-MicroNutrients.html).

From that table, we can get the total amount of nutrients and compare it to the recommendations:

### Deficiencies

Ok, that generally doesn't look so bad. Except for a few vitamins and minerals, the food alone has me covered pretty well. Some obvious (and expected) deficiencies are clearly vitamin D and B12. Vitamin D you don't really get from food, but rather from being outside in the sun. So this one also depends on your lifestyle, but people are generally deficient. I take 1000ID daily for that reason. Vitamin B12 is obtained from food, but mostly animal products. Since I am living mostly plant-based, I also supplement it. 

Let's look at the other dificiencies. Sodium is low - which makes sense, because non of the food that I list has any salt added. Just add some over your food afterwards, and you'll be covered. Don't add too much though, that's also not healthy!
