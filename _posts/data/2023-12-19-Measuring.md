If you want to identify the lifestyle choices that benefit you, and discard the ones that just suck up time and money, there's no way around measuring some aspects of your body function. Subjectively guessing if a certain supplement or a new sports protocol has a positive influence on your life might seem like an easy task, but trust me, you'll get lost in all of the noise. 

As an example, say you decide taking L-Theanine before going to bed to sleep better. Now in order to know if it's a supplement you want to keep using, you wake up the next morning and ask yourself the question if you slept better. You might rate how you are feeling and how recovered you feel, as opposed to the days before.
*Maybe slightly better?*
Then you might go through the day and in the evening you rate the amount of energy you had throughout the day.
*I think I felt a bit more focused today*.
Two things make this a hard task. First, unless you go through exactly the same routine every day, there might have been a few things that were different on this day compared to yesterday and the days before. Maybe a different breakfast, lunch or dinner. Maybe a workout. Maybe you spent the evening with friends, potentially had alocohol, or a Kombucha instead, or, or, or... Second, can you really remember how you felt and how much energy you had in the previous days. And with an accuracy to confidently compare it to today? Well, I certainly can't.

I've hopefully convinced you that in order to really evaluate whether a certain change in your life has positive (or negative) effects, you need to make sure you fulfill the following requirements:
- quantify the changes over a period of time to smooth out the effects of other lifestyle factors
- compare to a baseline period without the modification to check for a significant difference
- measure objectively, as it is much less prone to human error

My point is: **measuring is necessay, if you robustly want to evaluate a lifestyle modification**.

## Why I do it

I generally take measurements to keep track of my health, and to be able to make modifications to improve it.
I've spent a lot of time trying out things and optimising my lifestyle to get to the point that I'm at now. Without measurements, this would have been an impossible journey. Altough I'm sharing everything that I found to benefit me, I strongly encourage you to not blindly follow what I describe, but rather start measuring yourself to see if you get similarly positive results. Every person is different, and what works for me might not work the same way for you. By measuring, you will be able to explore both the ideas I'm proposing on this website and beyond.

## How I do it

For everything that I measure you will find more information on what aspects of my body function I want to record with it, when I measure it and what I use to measure it. 

I measure everything I'm tracking first thing in the morning. This is not only scientifically optimal for what I'm tracking, but it also gives me the complete freedom to not have to think about it the rest of the day. 

Here's my protocol.


After getting up I sit down and take the following readings:

- [blood pressure](/hidden_posts/measurements/2023-12-19-BloodPressure.html)
- [heart rate](/hidden_posts/measurements/2023-12-19-HeartRate.html)
- [body temperature](/hidden_posts/measurements/2023-12-19-Temperature.html)
