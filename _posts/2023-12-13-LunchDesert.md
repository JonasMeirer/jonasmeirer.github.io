I like to go to bed without feeling full from a heavy evening meal, so I try to eat most of my calories before lunch break ends. This desert has got me covered and is super tasty.


# Nuts, Seeds, Berries, etc.

## Goal
- Easy to batch-cook -- *I bring food to work, so I want to easily prepare it*
- Nutrient rich
- Avoids after-meal crash -- *productivity should continue after lunch, not end there*
- Tasty

## Recipe

### Ingredients
- 20g Macadamia nuts
- 25g Walnuts
- 2 Tbsp Flax seeds
