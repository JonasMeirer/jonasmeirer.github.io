### Without a watch

- App: EliteHRV
- Gear: Polar H10

I get my heart rate readings with my HRV reading. More specifically, I take the average heart rate during the 5min HRV reading as my readout. This is automatically exported to Apple Health by the EliteHRV app which I use for the HRV measurement.

### With a watch

For Apple users, I assume the "Breathe" app will also write heart rate to Apple Health when measuring the HRV.
