There's a bunch of automatic blood pressure cuffs out there. I use one that measures on the upper arm. Nothing fancy, just a 20$ one from Amazon. 

The two things that I follow every time to get reliable readings:

- 5min of still sitting before (this is the time where I measure my HRV)
- I always do 2 readings in a row and take the average (unless they are really far apart, then I repeat the procedure because probably something went wrong)


Here's more info on how to measure <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings/monitoring-your-blood-pressure-at-home" target="_blank">correctly</a>.
