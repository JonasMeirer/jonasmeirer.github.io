### Without a watch

- App: EliteHRV
- Gear: Polar H10 

In the EliteHRV app I trigger a 5min sitting HRV reading. 

### With a watch

I personally don't use a watch for HRV measurements. Usually those watches track HRV throughout the day/night, but I'm interested in only a single morning reading. Nevertheless, if you find a way to trigger a manual reading on your watch, this can also do the job. Make sure though that your watch fulfills your accuracy requirements - the optically obtained readings can give sub-ideal accuracy (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3329189.3329215" target="_blank">reference</a>). For the most accurate reading, I opt for an ECG-accurate chest strap like the Polar H10.

For Apple watch users (which seems to be accurate enough - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6111985/">reference</a>), it might not be easy to trigger a manual HRV reading. But there's a trick - just start a breath workout with the "Breathe" app and set the timer to 5min. This will also trigger an HRV reading that you can afterwards see in Apple Health.
