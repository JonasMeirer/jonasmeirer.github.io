### Why combine?

Pea protein is low in methionine, of which rice protein has more.  
Rice protein is low in lysine, and pea protein has a lot.  
Together, the two are quite balanced.  

Hemp is rich in fiber and has has some omega-3 and omega-6.  
It's good to have some variety in the proteins, so I add a little bit to the blend.
