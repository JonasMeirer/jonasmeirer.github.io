I've discovered intermittent fasting a few years ago, and for me it's been one of the most impactful lifestyle changes in terms of how I subjectively feel. Among the most important changes is an increased mental clarity in the morning, making me a lot more productive. It shifts focus away from food and frees up time spent eating breakfast. 

More to come on the science of it!
