Aww yes, that's my favorite. I love starting the day with a good long run. There's something magical about waking up early, jumping into your running shoes and feeling the fresh air outside. And trust me, when you hit lunch break, with a big workout and some productive work already done - *it's really only 12am?!*- you'll feel amazing! 

This workout needs a bit of time, so I usually do it on the homeoffice days, which is twice a week. 

## Morning run

### Prerequisites

- good mindset around running

### Workout

- just run at the speed you like
- for as long as you like - *I usuall try to aim for 45-90min* 


### Note

- this workout even works during lunchbreak  
*might be nicer in winter when it's dark in the morning - but maybe try to do it before eating lunch*
- or in the evening  
*but I try to not do it right before sleeping to not stress the body too much before going to bed*
