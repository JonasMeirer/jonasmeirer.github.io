On the days I go to the office, I like to get a little workout done before leaving the house - just to start the day right. 
I also don't want to get to work super late, so I limit the workout to 20 minutes. I figured this is a good balance between physical exhaustion and time spent. And believe me, a lot can happen in 20 min! 

The following is not so much about showing an optimised workout plan - really, choose any that you like. I just list what I do in case you need a starting point. It's generally just about moving your body and increasing your heart rate. Feels good to start the day like that! 

## Morning workout

### Prerequisites

- yoga mat 
- dumb bells (*or do another exercise which doesn't need one*)

### Exercises

- 2 min planking

- 1 min <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6PJMT2y8GQ" target="_blank">superman</a>
- 2min break
- 3 x 20 pushups *(with 1min breaks)*
- 3 x 20 bicep curls *(with 1min breaks)*

### How often?

Well, as often as you can.  
I usually do it 3x a week, especially on days where I don't have time for another workout.
