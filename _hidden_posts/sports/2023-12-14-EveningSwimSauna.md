This is my spa evening, plus a little sport. And this is where my food routine is extra nice. I go right after work, skipping dinner. This gives me time to swim and then enjoy a few rounds of sauna, with a good book for the breaks. Not having to think about food makes this super nice, because it frees up the whole evening. To still get enough calories, I just tend to eat a bit more for lunch.

- a public pool with a sauna
