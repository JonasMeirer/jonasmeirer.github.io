Ohh yes, time to relax (and well, do a little sport before that to make it extra rewarding). This is my spa evening, giving me time for myself to unwind. I even find the swimming kinda meditative - altough there's also an aspect of willpowertraining to it, since it can be brutally boring if you don't get into this meditative state where it just flows. Well, what doesn't kill you...

Anyways, I usually go right after work, skipping dinner. And this is the point where I again will talk about my glorious diet routine. Because I ate most of my calories before the evening, I can easily skip dinner, saving a lot of time that can instead spend sweating in the sauna. I'll just eat a bit more for lunch, and I'm good until the next day. 



## Swim + Sauna

### Prerequisites

- a public pool with a sauna

### Workout

*I do it in one go, takes ~45min*

*take a good book!*
