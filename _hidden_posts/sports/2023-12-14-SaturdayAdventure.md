Well before I talk about saturdays, let me mention sundays. I love to spend sundays hanging out with friends, having brunch or getting cozy on the couch with a good book. But believe me, all of that feels 10x better when you start the weekend with an outdoor adventure on saturday morning. And it should be exhausting. The more you push, the better the couch will feel on sunday! 

I like to start the weekend early, and then head straight to the mountains. Spending the day like that is like a little vacation for me - it's the time to completely detach from work and focus on the other things you love. 

So, grab some friends and enjoy the time outdoors!
